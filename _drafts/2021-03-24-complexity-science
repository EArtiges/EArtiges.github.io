summary: Where we look at a modern fresque.

Complexity Science cuts across a broad range of fields and provides us with an array of tools and methods to study any situation involving several parts of a puzzle interacting with each other. There is no single Object of Study: rather, provided that an object, organism, concept or situation can be expressed under the form of a so-called **Complex System**, it can become the Object of Study of complexity science.

When taking a look at the <a href="https://www.art-sciencefactory.com/complexity-map_feb09.html" target="_blank"> Map of the Complexity Sciences by Brian Castellani </a>, many scientific concepts that are still considered "hot" today can be tied to the notion of complexity in one way or another.

Some escaped the research labs and made their way into our lives through mainstream media:
* Network science (remember that 6-people thing?)
* Big data
* Artificial intelligence (Skynet, anyone?)
* Cognitive science
* Chaos theory (as introduced to many of us by a shirtless Jeff Goldblum in 1993's <i>Jurassic Park</i>)
* Intersectionality

Some are more confidential and are rather well-known from those among us that are more technical <small> (or at least I assume so, not having heard any of these names pronounced outside of an academic institution myself) </small> :
* Systems biology
* Agent-Based modeling
* Non-linear Systems
* Control Theory
* Econophysics
