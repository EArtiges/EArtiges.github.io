## Complex Systems: introduction

> Picture the world interacting

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system" target="_blank">  From Complex Systems on wikipedia </a>

A complex system is a system composed of many components which may interact with each other. Such systems' behaviors are intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. They exhibit properties such as nonlinearity, emergence, spontaneous order, adaptation, and feedback loops, among others.

Because such systems appear in a wide variety of fields, the commonalities among them have become the topic of their independent area of research, which investigates how relationships between a system's parts give rise to its collective behaviors and how the system interacts and forms relationships with its environment.

"Systems exhibit complexity" means that their behaviors cannot be easily inferred from their properties. Any modeling approach that ignores such difficulties or characterizes them as noise, then, will necessarily produce models that are neither accurate nor useful.

Another common feature of complex systems is the presence of emergent behaviors and properties: these are traits of a system that are not apparent from its components in isolation but which result from the interactions, dependencies, or relationships they form when placed together in a system. Emergence broadly describes the appearance of such behaviors and properties, and has applications to systems studied in both the social and physical sciences. While emergence is often used to refer only to the appearance of unplanned organized behavior in a complex system, emergence can also refer to the breakdown of an organization; it describes any phenomena which are difficult or even impossible to predict from the smaller entities that make up the system.

"Complex Systems" is the new approach to science studying how relationships between parts give rise to the collective behaviors of a  system, and how the system interacts and forms  relationships  with  its  environment.  Social  systems  formed  (in  part)  out  of relationships between people, the brain formed out of neurons, molecules formed out of atoms,  the  weather  formed  out  of  air  flows  are  all  examples  of  complex  systems. Studying   complex   systems cuts   across   all   of   science,   as   well   as   engineering, management,  and  medicine.  It  is  also  relevant  to  art,  history,  literature  and  other humanities. It focuses on certain questions about  relationships and how they make parts into wholes. These questions are relevant to all systems that we care about.

About interdependence: Pushing  on  a  complex  system  "here"  often has effects "over there" because the parts are interdependent. This has become more and more  apparent  in  our  efforts  to  solve  societal  problems  or  avoid  ecological  disasters caused  by  our  own  actions.  The  field  of  complex  systems  provides  a  number  of sophisticated tools, some of them concepts that help us think about these  systems, some of  them  analytical  for  studying  these  systems  in  greater  depth,  and  some  of  them computer-based for describing, modeling or simulating these systems.  

About pattern formation: When someone paints a picture, they place each patch of paint in a particular place to make the picture. In nature we notice that there are patterns that form without someone putting each part in a particular place. The pattern seems simply to happen by itself. It self-organizes. Sometimes these patterns are regular, like ripples of sand on a beach or in the desert, sometimes  they  are  very  intricate  and  have  an  intricate  functioning[, such as ] the human body itself, which forms from a single cell by a process of development.

As  scientists,  we  would  like  to  understand  how  this  self-organizing  process  takes  place. We would like to understand the mechanism by which patterns form. We would also like to understand how the pattern that arises is determined. This could lead to a revolution in engineering and in management. The idea is that instead of specifying each of the parts of a system we want to build, we can specify a process that will create the  system that we want to make. This process would use the natural dynamics of the world to help us create what we want to make.

There  is  another  motivation  for  understanding  self-organizing  patterns.  Patterns  of behavior  of  human  beings  in  economic  and  social  systems  also  cannot  be  explained directly  from  external  forces.  External  forces  cannot  explain  fads  of  people  buying products, and price changes in stock markets where prices change dramatically from day to day or even minute to minute. Traditional economics tries to understand how behavior is related to external forces. The interactions between people are, however, important in creating  fads  and  market  panics  as  well  as  day-to-day  fluctuations.  These  are  self-organizing  patterns.  Without  understanding  how  patterns  arise  from  the  interactions inside a system we cannot understand these behaviors.

On complexity and information: More  generally,  a  complex system  is  hard  to  describe  and  the  problem  of  describing  it  is  central  to  our  ability  to understand it. Imagine that we have to study a description of the system. The longer the description,  the  longer  we  would  have  to  study  it.  This  makes  it  natural  to  define  the complexity of an object as the length of the description. An object that is more complex has a longer description. A simpler object has a shorter description. The idea that complexity is measured by the length of the description seems, however, to suggest  that  complexity  is  a  very  slippery  thing.  If  we  are  describing  something  to another person, the length of a description that we need depends on what the other person knows, and even what language we are using. The idea that complexity is not an absolute, but is relative to who is giving the description and who is receiving the description should not discourage us from thinking about complexity. Descriptions are always relative to the observer and this is even recognized in physics.

On increasing complexity around us, in social systems: We can also learn that the change in central control is going to continue. The world, with billions  of  people,  can  become  much  more  complex  than  a  human  being.  We  should expect that complexity will continue to increase, and this means that organizations will be less and less recognizable as hierarchies. We see this in many ways, even by considering how  informal  distributed  organizations  like  the  open-source  movement  are  challenging innovative but conventional organizations like Microsoft.

On the distinction between complex systems, simple systems and intricated systems: Cette caractérisation oppose d’abord les systèmes complexes aux systèmes « simples », dans lesquels les interactions sont faibles et n’engendrent pas de propriétés surprenantes au niveau collectif. Ainsi, en dehors de rares chocs, les atomes d’un gaz suivent des trajectoires aléatoires, indépendamment les uns des autres, et les propriétés d’ensemble du gaz peuvent se calculer assez simplement.

La définition différencie également les systèmes complexes des systèmes « compliqués », dans lesquels le tout n’émerge pas spontanément mais en suivant le plan global d’un architecte, comme dans le cas d’un avion ou d’un ordinateur. Au contraire, la construction des fourmilières et de leurs multiples galeries est un exemple canonique de système complexe, car elle est menée à bien par les ouvrières, sans coordination centrale par une reine qui en détiendrait le plan.

Traditionally, fundamental science explores the very small and the very large, both of which lie beyond man's everyday perception. The uniqueness of complex systems is that they have to do with a class of phenomena of fundamental importance in which the system and the observer may evolve on comparable time and space scales.

A system perceived as complex induces a characteristic phenomenology the principal signature of which is the multiplicity of possible outcomes, endowing it with the capacity to choose, to explore and to adapt. This process can be manifested in different ways.

* The emergence of traits encompassing the system as whole, that can in no way be reduced to the properties of the constituent parts. Emergent properties reflect the primordial role of interactions between parts. They are manifested by the creation of self-organized states of a hierarchical and modular type, where order and coherence are ensured by a bottom-up mechanism rather than through a top-down design and control. Classical laboratory scale examples of this behavior are found in fluids under stress (e.g. Rayleigh-Benard cells in a fluid heated from below) and in open chemically reacting systems (e.g. bistability, oscillations, Turing patterns and wave fronts in the Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction and related systems). Further examples, in naturally occurring systems, are provided by the communication and control networks in living matter, from the genetic to the organismic to the population level.
* The intertwining, within the same phenomenon, of large scale regularities and seemingly erratic evolutionary trends. This coexistence of order and disorder raises the issue of predictability of the future evolution of the system at hand on the basis of the record available. Typical examples are provided by the atmosphere in connection with the familiar difficulty to issue reliable weather forecasts beyond a horizon of a few days, as well as by extreme geological and environmental phenomena such as earthquakes and floods. Human systems such as traders in stock markets influencing both each other and the market itself are also confronted to unexpected crises and collapses, despite the rationality supposed to prevail at the individual level. Fractals, deterministic chaos and its extreme form of fully developed turbulence provide valuable prototypes of coexistence of order and disorder in time and space. 

In addition to its macroscopic level manifestations complexity is also ubiquitous at the microscopic level. Systems with built-in disorder like glassy materials give rise to a rich variety of evolutionary processes driven by microscopic level interactions. A variety of systems operating on the nanometer scale exhibit complex behaviors like energy transduction and anomalous transport, arising from the interplay between microscopically generated spontaneous fluctuations and systematic environmental constraints. The very origin of irreversibility is related to the intrinsic complexity of the dynamics of the atoms constituting a macroscopic system under the effect of their mutual interactions.

# Technical Notes

To have several p5 canvas on the same page, I use the <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js-overview#instantiation--namespace" target="_blank">instance mode of p5</a> as further explained in <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/p5" target="_blank">the documentation</a>. Each canvas becomes its own object with its own object, which means that at the cost of some re-writing (the function that are usually available in the global namespace have to be accessed through the sketch object itself) we get to display several canvas without them messing with each other.
