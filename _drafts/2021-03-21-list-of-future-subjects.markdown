> Reminder: you're doing this for FUN, not for productivity. No need to look for unique selling points or to try to do something no one has ever done before. It's a personal blog (and by moments a portfolio), not a research lab. You will learn about science, stats and dataviz by writing the articles and the code: what matters is that it was written by YOU <3
