This is my blog. As a physicist trained in classical Physics and Complex Systems in the [University Claude Bernard](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/) and the [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/), I enjoy turning problems into elegant and beautiful maths. Here I want to document things that I learn in my journey through the world of Data Science and that I don't want to forget.

I am inspired by people like [Edward R. Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) and [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/) to give beautiful and easy to grasp explanations, and I hope that one day I manage to write a post that I can confidently call an [explorable explanation](https://explorabl.es/).

I live and work now in Edinburgh, Scotland.
